Event listener structure:

    target.addEventListener(target, callback[, options])

        target:             event target
        addEventListener:   event listener method
        target:             event to be listened to
        callback:           callback function to run when event triggered (called to listener and run inside)
        options:            typically "false" or left blank (advanced feature)
