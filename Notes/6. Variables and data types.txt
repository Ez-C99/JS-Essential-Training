Chapter 6: Variables and Data Types

var = classic variable container
    - globally scoped --> scope issues
    - mutable --> change value at any time and assign new value
    - default if forget to declare type of variable being created
    - can declare multiple in same statement, separated by comma

let = locally block scoped variable container
    - can't be called from outside local scope --> control of variable existence and use 
    - use for changeable or mutable variables (default)

const = unchageable block scoped variable
    - value can't be reassigned to variable
    - properties of object inside can still be changed

==
    - Equality operator
    - Similar values on either side e.g. 5 and "5"

!=
    - Inequality operator

=== 
    - Strict equality operator
    - Identical values on either side

typeof
    - The typeof operator determines the type of a given object.

+
    - The unary plus operator converts its operand to Number type.

-
    - The unary negation operator converts its operand to Number type and then negates it.

~
    - Bitwise NOT operator.

!
    - Logical NOT operator.

+ (Plus)
    - Addition operator.

-
    - Subtraction operator.

/
    - Division operator.

*
    - Multiplication operator.

%
    - Remainder operator.

**
    - Exponentiation operator.

< (Less than)
    - Less than operator.

> (Greater than)
    - Greater than operator.

<=
    - Less than or equal operator.

>=
    - Greater than or equal operator.
