<!--
  Moving script tag to end isn't actually solution, just a hack

  By default, browser stops rendering when JS encountered. JS executed
  before rendering continues (content blocking)


  Solutions:

  Async = Browser downloads JS in parallel while HTML renders. When JS loaded,
          rendering stops while JS executed
  - Dramatically shortens browser execution time  
  - Good to parse ASAP without care for render blocking

  Defer = Browser downloads JS in parallel while HTML renders, then defers JS
          execution until HTML rendering complete

ASNYC / DEFER SHOULD BE STANDARD
